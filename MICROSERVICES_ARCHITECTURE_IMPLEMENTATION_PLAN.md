## 🐳 Docker Implementation Strategy

### 📦 Service Containerization
Each microservice will have:
- **Multi-stage Dockerfile** for optimization
- **Health check endpoints** for monitoring
- **Environment-based configuration**
- **Security scanning integration**

### 🔄 Docker Compose Structure
```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  # Core Trading Services
  blockchain-service:
    build: ./services/blockchain-service
    ports: ["5001:5001"]
    environment:
      - NODE_ENV=production
      - REDIS_URL=redis://redis:6379
    depends_on: [redis, postgres]
    
  trading-service:
    build: ./services/trading-service
    ports: ["5002:5002"]
    depends_on: [blockchain-service, redis]
    
  # Additional services...
```
